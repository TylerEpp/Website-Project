      <p2><center><font size="8">This category is fairly new and only came to be with the introduction of the Seadoo Spark. For awhile all watercraft were getting bigger and bigger to better suit ride comfort but this took away the simple fun that you got from smaller and lighter machines.
  When the watercraft first came out they were really small and light machines that could be thrown around and launched out of the water. As time went on people favored more comfortable ride because now you had things like towable tubes and needed something that could not only pull a tube but pull for a good amount of time without wearing out the driver.</font></center></p2>
